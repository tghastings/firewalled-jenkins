It is designed to resemble the MVC architecture from frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the more modern, data-oriented style of web app development. It's especially good for building realtime features like chat.\n\n\n## Installation &nbsp;\n**With [node](http://nodejs.org) [installed](http://sailsjs.org/#!documentation/new-to-nodejs):**\n```sh\n# Get the latest stable release of Sails\n$ npm install sails -g\n```\n\n> ######Upgrading from 0.10 or 0.11?\n> The v0.12 release of Sails contains a few breaking changes which affect userland. To read the v0.12 migration guide, click [here](http://sailsjs.org/version-notes/0point12-migration-guide).\n\n\n## Your First Sails Project\n\n**Create a new app:**\n```sh\n# Create the app\n$ sails new testProject\n```\n\n**Lift sails:**\n```sh\n# cd into the new folder\n$ cd testProject\n\n# fire up the server\n$ sails lift\n```\n\n**Generate a REST API:**\n\n[![ScreenShot](http://i.imgur.com/Ii88jlhl.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK-tFvpIR7c)\n\n\n## Compatibility\n\nSails is built on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/).\n\nSails [controllers](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/controllers) are compatible with Connect middleware, so in most cases, you can paste code into Sails from an existing Express project and everything will work-- plus you'll be able to use WebSockets to talk to your API, and vice versa.\n\nThe ORM, [Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline), has a well-defined adapter system for supporting all kinds of datastores.  Officially supported databases include [MySQL](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-mysql), [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-postgresql), [MongoDB](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-mongo), [Redis](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-redis), local [disk](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-disk), and local [memory](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-memory).  [Community adapters](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/master/contributing/intro-to-custom-adapters.md#notable-community-adapters) exist for [CouchDB](https://github.com/search?q=sails+couch&nwo=codeswarm%2Fsails-couchdb-orm&search_target=global&ref=cmdform), [neDB](https://github.com/adityamukho/sails-nedb), [TingoDB](https://github.com/andyhu/sails-tingo), [SQLite](https://github.com/AndrewJo/sails-sqlite3/tree/0.10), [Oracle](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%22sails+oracle%22+OR+%22waterline+oracle%22&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults), [MSSQL](https://github.com/misterGF/sails-mssqlserver), [DB2](https://github.com/search?q=sails+db2&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults), [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/search?q=%28elasticsearch+AND+sails%29+OR+%28elasticsearch+AND+waterline%29+&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults), [Riak](https://github.com/search?q=sails+riak&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults),\n[neo4j](https://www.npmjs.org/package/sails-neo4j), [OrientDB](https://github.com/appscot/sails-orientdb),\n[Amazon RDS](https://github.com/TakenPilot/sails-rds), [DynamoDB](https://github.com/TakenPilot/sails-dynamodb), [Azure Tables](https://github.com/azuqua/sails-azuretables), [RethinkDB](https://github.com/gutenye/sails-rethinkdb) and [Solr](https://github.com/sajov/sails-solr); for various 3rd-party REST APIs like Quickbooks, Yelp, and Twitter, including a configurable generic [REST API adapter](https://github.com/zohararad/sails-rest); plus some [eclectic projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmcQZD_LIAE).\n\n<!-- Core adapter logos -->\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mysql.com\">\n  <img width=\"75\" src=\"http://www.mysql.com/common/logos/powered-by-mysql-125x64.png\" alt=\"Powered by MySQL\" title=\"sails-mysql: MySQL adapter for Sails\"/>\n</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/\"><img width=\"50\" title=\"PostgreSQL\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/OSlDDKv.png\"/></a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mongodb.org/\"><img width=\"100\" title=\"MongoDB\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/bC2j13z.png\"/></a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://redis.io/\"><img width=\"75\" title=\"Redis\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/dozv0ub.jpg\"/></a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n<!-- /core adapter logos -->\n\n## Books\n- [Sails.js in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/sails-js-in-action) by Mike McNeil and Irl Nathan (Manning Publications).

After building a few applications and taking them into production, we realized that the Node.js development landscape was very much still the Wild West.  Over time, after trying lots of different methodologies, we decided to crystallize all of our best practices into this framework.  Four years later, Sails is now one of the most widely-used web application frameworks in the world. We hope it saves you some time! :)\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](http://sails.mit-license.org/)  Copyright © 2012-2016 Mike McNeil\n\n> Sails is built around so many great open-source technologies that it would never have crossed our minds to keep it proprietary.  We owe huge gratitude and props to TJ Holowaychuk ([@visionmedia](https://github.com/visionmedia)) and Guillermo Rauch ([@rauchg](https://github.com/rauchg)) for the work they've done, as well as the stewards of all the other open-source modules we use.  Sails could never have been developed without your tremendous contributions to the node community.\n\n![image_squidhome@2x.png](http://sailsjs.org/images/bkgd_squiddy.png)\n",
